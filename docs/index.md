# <img src="/images/thiefmd_64.png" style="float: left; height: 1em; width: 1em;" /> ThiefMD, the Markdown Editor worth stealing

Based on Open Source Technologies, ThiefMD is a Markdown editor and file manager inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). ThiefMD is based on open source code from [Quilter](https://github.com/lainsce/quilter) and [other projects](/about#credit).

Manage your <span class="pun">\*\*mark\*\*</span> without any <span class="ny">\-down\-</span>sides. Your library is your file system. Sync using any service you choose[^no-file-sync]. Even use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to have a file history[^no-git].

[^no-file-sync]: ThiefMD has no sync support built in.
[^no-git]: ThiefMD has no built in Git support.
