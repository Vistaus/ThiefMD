# ThiefMD, the Markdown Editor built on the shoulders of others

Born from Open Source without knowing how Open Source works. ThiefMD is a Markdown editor and file manager inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app), based on open source code from [Quilter](https://github.com/lainsce/quilter) and other projects.

Manage your <span class="pun">\*\*mark\*\*</span> without any <span class="ny">\-down\-</span>sides. Your library is your file system. Sync using any service you choose[^no-file-sync]. Even use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to have a file history[^no-git].

[^no-file-sync]: ThiefMD has no sync support built in.
[^no-git]: ThiefMD has no built in Git support.

## We'll try not to delete all your files

✅ Auto-save  
✅ Live Previews  
✅ Typewriter Scrolling  
✅ Full Screen Editing

If anything goes wrong, it's probably because we implemented it wrong.  We're not liable for lost files or damage to your machine!

# Live Preview

See what your work looks like in real time. Is that your battery draining? Yes, and the Markdown it's powering never looked so good.
