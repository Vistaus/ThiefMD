We understand some users use Accessible GTK themes. By default, ThiefMD will now use the user's GTK theme, and have "Match UI to Editor Theme" toggle the Window Decoration coloring.

<!-- more -->

* Improve accessibility by allowing toggle of usage of user's GTK Theme
* In [ePub YAML front-matter](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata), ThiefMD can now find the full path to your cover-image during publishing
* Working on some support for other static site generators
* Squashing more bugs
