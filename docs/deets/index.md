Relative paths? Absolute paths? Don't worry, ThiefMD will find the image you're looking for.

A separate window lets allows for better positioning, or multi-monitor support. Focus on your writing, or focus on your reading.

## Compilation & Multi-Format Export

<img src="/images/export_menu.png" style="width: 30%; float: right;" />

Large projects go well broken down into smaller tasks. The same thing goes for [great writing](/tips/novel-writing).

ThiefMD supports exporting your work from multiple folders and files. Publish to PDF to send to friends over e-mail. [ePub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) if you want to preview your novel in your favorite e-Reader. docx or LaTeX if you're getting ready to turn in a report or dissertation.

However big the task, and wherever you need to take it, ThiefMD has you covered[^okay-its-pandoc].

[^okay-its-pandoc]: Export powered by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). [Let us know](https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD/issues) if we don't have you covered.,

Stay centered and stay focused. Type writer scrolling keeps your active line fixed, both in the editor and the preview.

## YAML Frontmatter

In the Preferences Window (`Ctrl + ,`), you can now drag [Ulysses Themes](https://styles.ulysses.app/themes) into the app and use them. Additional themes can be found on our [Themes Page](https://themes.thiefmd.com), or [make your own themes](https://themes.thiefmd.com/howto) from scratch.
