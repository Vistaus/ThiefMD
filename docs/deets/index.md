## Live Preview

`Ctrl + Shift + P` and see your markdown rendered instantly. Live preview updates as you type.

A separate window lets allows for better positioning, or multi-monitor support. Focus on your writing, or focus on your reading.

## Typewriter Scrolling

![](/images/typewriter_scrolling.gif)

Stay centered and stay focused. Type writer scrolling keeps your active line fixed, both in the editor and the preview.

## YAML Frontmatter
