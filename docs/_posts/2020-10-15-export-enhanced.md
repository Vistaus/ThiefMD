Export Themes and Paper options are here! Customize the Preview CSS, ePub CSS, and PDF CSS.

Whether you need [dark mode preview](https://themes.thiefmd.com/2020/10/07/preview-inverted), looking to match your site, or need that special touch for your ePub, ThiefMD has you covered.

ThiefMD can now even import your (or someone else's) existing work! Just drag and drop a file into a folder in the Library. If it's compatible, ThiefMD will convert it to Markdown. Results may vary, and they may even be very cool.
