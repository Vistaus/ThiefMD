# Linux Writing Tools

Looking to get started writing in Linux? Here's a list of apps we enjoy from [flathub](https://flathub.org). These apps will work on most Linux distributions with minimal effort.

## Cloud Storage & Sync

[DropBox](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.dropbox.Client) or [VGrive](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.bcedu.vgrive) (Google Drive) will help keep you in sync. Work from multiple computers, or stay confident with your files backed up to the cloud.

## Mind Mapping

[Minder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.phase1geo.minder). Looking to capture your thoughts, map out progression, or visualize how everything links together? Minder is a great app for that.

## ePub Reader

[Foliate](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate) is a simple e-reader for Linux. With multiple viewing modes, you'll be sure to find the one that keeps you turning pages.

## Twitter

[Cawbird](https://flathub.org/apps/details/uk.co.ibboard.cawbird) will help you stay up to date in the twitterverse. Share what your working on or just take a break.
